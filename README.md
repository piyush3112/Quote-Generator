# Quote-Generator
Quote-Generator website is a modern website which generates random quotes in which we have used asynchronous fetch request to rest API in order to get quotes  
So in this project, We have implemented an asynchronous fetch request to arrest API in order to get our quotes.
But we're actually going to run in to the dreaded cause error. And we have resolved that problem in case you encounter it in the future using a proxy API.
The first of these elements is adding a hero patterns vector background. So that will allow you to make it look unique. 
We have also used font awesome icons here and a custom Google font
Down at the bottom, we have two buttons.The first is a new quote button.
We have a loader that loads between quotes. The idea is that when this takes a long time to load, which it does sometimes want to signal to the
user that something is happening behind the scenes, even if they can't see it like right there. And the other button we have is a Twitter button.
So when we click on this, it will open Twitter in a new tab. And if we were logged in, it will allow us to tweet using this button.
The very last thing when a show is that this project is also mobile, responsive as well.
